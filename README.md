# Design of FFT processor using low power Vedic multiplier for wireless communication

Modified binary floating-point multiplier using Vedic mathematics Urdhva-Tiryakbhyam technique is used for high-speed multiplication.

32-bit Binary floating-point multiplier using Kogge stone adder is better in terms of power, area and power delay product compared to ripple carry adder.

Floating point Vedic multiplier and Vedic adder is more advantageous over power and power delay product in implementation with various radix 2K single path delay feedback FFT architectures.
